## 🧠 About the Project

> “The best way to get started on the path to sharing your work is to think about what you want to learn, and make that the focus of your sharing.”  
> <em>– Austin Kleon, Show Your Work! (p. 21)</em>

This is a humorous JavaScript web app.  
You type **any question**—the site answers **YES**.  
It’s built to make people laugh and to share something you created publicly.
